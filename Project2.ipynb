If the summer turns out to be sunny, Adam has two options: he can either purchase a season pass or not. If he chooses to buy a season pass, it would cost him 15 dollars. If he decides against purchasing the season pass, he will need to pay 6 dollars for entering the domed pool on the 6 rainy days in the sunny summer. Comparing these options for a sunny summer, Adam pays less if he opts not to purchase the season pass because it costs him only 6 dollars. On the other hand, if the summer turns out to be rainy, he again has the choice of buying the season pass for 15 dollars or not buying it. If he doesn't buy the season pass, he would have to pay 30 dollars for entering the domed pool on the 30 rainy days. Considering these options, buying the season pass (15 dollars) is less expensive than the alternative. Overall, by multiplying the relevant probabilities with 6 dollars and 15 dollars and summarizing them (6 * 0.6 + 15 * 0.4 = 9.6 dollars), 9.6 dollars represents the expected value of perfect information. If Adam were to purchase the season pass directly, it would cost him 15 dollars. Calculating the difference between 9.6 dollars and 15 dollars (-9.6-(-15) = 5.4 dollars), it is found that 5.4 dollars is the upper limit for the expected value of perfect information (EVPI). This means that Adam can pay a maximum of 5.4 dollars for absolute information about whether the summer will be rainy or sunny."

    "**if Adam does not purchase the forecast,** he again has two options: buying a season pass or not. If Adam buys the season pass, he pays 15 dollars. However, if he chooses not to buy the season pass, there are two possible events with a 0.6 probability of a sunny summer and a 0.4 probability of a rainy summer. If the summer turns out to be sunny, with an average of 6 rainy days, Adam pays 1 dollar for entering the domed pool for these six days, totaling 6 dollars. On the other hand, if the summer is rainy, with an average of 30 rainy days, he pays 30 dollars. Multiplying these costs by the probability values: 6 * 0.6 + 30 * 0.4 = 15.6 dollars. As seen in the decision tree, a cost of 15 dollars is a better choice than a cost of 15.6 dollars. Thus, if Adam does not purchase the long-range weather forecast, his minimum cost is 15 dollars.\n",

    "**If a sunny summer is predicted,** Adam faces two decisions: buying a season pass or not. If he buys the season pass, he will pay 16 dollars (15 dollars for the season pass, 1 dollar for the forecast). However, if he decides not to buy the season pass, there will be two possible outcomes: a sunny summer with a probability of 0.7 and a rainy summer with a probability of 0.3. If the summer turns out to be sunny, with an average of six rainy days, he pays 7 dollars (6 * 1 dollar for entering the domed pool, 1 dollar for the forecast). However, if the summer is rainy, with an average of 30 rainy days, Adam pays 31 dollars (30 * 1 dollar for entering the domed pool, 1 dollar for the forecast). If these values are multiplied by their respective probabilities 7 * 0.7 + 31 * 0.3 = 14.2 dollars, Adam pays a minimum of 14.2 dollars. When comparing 14.2 dollars and 16 dollars, a cost of 14.2 dollars is better than 16 dollars.\n",

    "**If a rainy summer is predicted by the forecast,** Adam again has two options. He can buy the season pass for 16 dollars, or he can choose not to buy the season pass. If he decides not to buy the season pass, there would be two possible outcomes: a sunny summer with a probability of 0.2 or a rainy summer with a probability of 0.8. If the summer turns out to be sunny, he pays only 7 dollars. On the other hand, if the summer is rainy, he pays 31 dollars. Again, these values are multiplied by their respective probability values 31 * 0.8 + 7 * 0.2 = 26.2 dollars, so Adam may pay 26.2 dollars if he does not buy the season pass while the long-range forecast predicts a rainy summer. When comparing 26.2 dollars and 16 dollars, paying 16 dollars is a better choice than paying 26.2 dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "When multiplying the related probabilities with 16 dollars (predicted rainy summer) and 14.2 dollars (predicted sunny summer) and summing them: 14.2 * 0.8 + 16 * 0.2 = 14.2 dollars, Adam pays a minimum of 14.2 dollars. If 14.2 dollars are compared with 15 dollars, paying 14.2 dollars would be a better choice for Adam. Therefore, if Adam purchases the long-range weather forecast, he pays less than the no-purchasing choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing the first decision tree, Adam pays 1 dollar more for the long-range weather forecast in addition to the season pass. Also, if he does not purchase this forecast, he buys the season pass for 15 dollars rather than 16 dollars. Thus, the difference between these values (16 - 15 = 1 dollar) gives the value of sample information (EVSI). In this problem, EVSI is 1 dollar.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The optimum decision for Adam** would be purchasing long-range weather forecast information, and if it predicts a sunny summer, Adam should not purchase the season pass. Besides that, if the forecast predicts a rainy summer, Adam should purchase the season pass."
